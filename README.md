# \# 📁 Search-And-Copy

# 

# A desktop utility built for H\&O to streamline the process of locating and copying image files from legacy directories. Designed to assist with product identification workflows using \*Degem Sapak\* and \*Degem\* codes.

# 

# \## 🧠 Purpose

# 

# At H\&O, we often needed to retrieve multiple product images from a large archive of historical files. This tool simplifies that task by allowing users to input a list of search terms and automatically copy matching files to a designated output folder.

# 

# \## 🚀 Features

# 

# \- ✅ \*\*Batch Search\*\*: Input multiple search strings (Degem Sapak / Degem) at once.

# \- 📂 \*\*Source \& Destination Selection\*\*: Choose where to search and where to copy results.

# \- 🔍 \*\*Exact Match Flag\*\*: Only copy files whose names exactly match the search string.

# \- 🔁 \*\*Duplicate Flag\*\*: Allow multiple matches for the same search string.

# \- 🖼️ \*\*Image Filtering\*\*: Automatically filters for `.jpg` and `.png` files.

# \- 🧾 \*\*Error Reporting\*\*: Displays any files that failed to copy and why.

#
